# 8Tile
8 Tile game solver implemented using Artificial Intelligence search algorithms

# Types of searches used:

## Uninformed Searches:
1. Breadth-First Search
2. Depth-First Search
3. Uniform Cost Search (where path costs are based on values of the tiles being moved)

## Heuristic Searches
1. Best-First Search (using the heuristic function h1(n) = No. of misplaced tiles relative to the goal)
2. A* Search with h1(n) as above
3. A* Search with h2(n) = Sum of Manhattan distances of tiles from the correct positions
